This project aims to try and map human behaviour artefacts like noise and motion to availability of light energy in buildings. This data can then be used to design solar powered Energy Harvesting Sensors that can last for a long time with very little maintainance. 

The contents of this repo are: 
  1. The transfer function models workbook for Oracle
  2. The images and plots
  
We believe there is no need to set anything up because the notebook we shared is hosted on Google Colab, which has all required packages installed.
