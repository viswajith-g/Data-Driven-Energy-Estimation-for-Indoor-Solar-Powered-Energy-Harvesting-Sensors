This project aims to try and map human behaviour artefacts like noise and motion to availability of light energy in buildings. This data can then be used to design solar powered Energy Harvesting Sensors that can last for a long time with very little maintainance. 

The contents of this repo are: 
  1. The transfer function models workbook for Oracle
  2. The images and plots
  


Setup instructions:
- Download the ipynb notebook and upload to Google Colab.

- The data from RPIs is stored on Google Drive. Go to the shared drive folder "sahb_project" under My Drive > "Shared with me" or from the following link:
[Data GDrive Link (UVA Access)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17nwR-J_MWU3Q3uYeyw71nZvB8Q-FVkCx?usp=share_link) Either do "Create shortcut" or clone the folder on your Google Drive with the same name "sahb_project", and all paths should automatically line up. 

- The data from building sensors is already pulled by the notebook using the LLL book.

- We believe there is no need to set any packages up since Google Colab has all the required packages installed. We also provide internal commands for dependency installation within the notebook, so a direct 'Run All' should work.
